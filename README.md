## Infrastructure and architecture


### Cloud DataCenters

### Ease of use
other teams ae going to use he tools we create. Theywont use them if they are not user freindly.

If the devs do not use our tools , then there will be delays in deployment.

### Flexibiity
Other teams are going to want to use the code. It can be easy to get locked in to using a specific product, tool or software. It then becomes hard for the company to keep up with industry changes.

Everything the company uses should be easily changed or updated as the business needs change.

### Robustness
we need to be as close to 100% uptime as possible for our companies services

we are responsible for achieving this as DevOps engineers.

### Cost
Cost is often overlooked. we need to make sure the company is being as efficient as possible in it's tech dealings

For example how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task. do we need certain servers running.
